# Trying out the Developer PoR example

This template provides an end-to-end Proof-of-Reserve (PoR) example (including precompiled smart contracts). It's designed to showcase key CRE capabilities and help you get started with local simulation quickly.

Follow the steps below to run the example:

## 1. Initialize CRE project

Start by initializing a new CRE project. This will scaffold the necessary project structure and a template workflow. Run cre init in the directory where you'd like your CRE project to live.

Example output:

```
Project name?: my_cre_project
✔ Custom data feed: Typescript updating on-chain data periodically using offchain API data
✔ Workflow name?: workflow01
```

## 2. Update .env file

You need to add a private key to the .env file. This is specifically required if you want to simulate chain writes. For that to work the key should be valid and funded.
If your workflow does not do any chain write then you can keep a dummy key as a private key. e.g.

```
CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

## 3. Install dependencies

If `bun` is not already installed, see https://bun.com/docs/installation for installing in your environment.

```bash
cd <workflow-name> && bun install
```

Example: For a workflow directory named `workflow01` the command would be:

```bash
cd workflow01 && bun install
```

## 4. Configure RPC endpoints

For local simulation to interact with a chain, you must specify RPC endpoints for the chains you interact with in the `project.yaml` file. This is required for submitting transactions and reading blockchain state.

Note: The following 7 chains are supported in local simulation (both testnet and mainnet variants):

- Ethereum (`ethereum-testnet-sepolia`, `ethereum-mainnet`)
- Base (`ethereum-testnet-sepolia-base-1`, `ethereum-mainnet-base-1`)
- Avalanche (`avalanche-testnet-fuji`, `avalanche-mainnet`)
- Polygon (`polygon-testnet-amoy`, `polygon-mainnet`)
- BNB Chain (`binance-smart-chain-testnet`, `binance-smart-chain-mainnet`)
- Arbitrum (`ethereum-testnet-sepolia-arbitrum-1`, `ethereum-mainnet-arbitrum-1`)
- Optimism (`ethereum-testnet-sepolia-optimism-1`, `ethereum-mainnet-optimism-1`)

Add your preferred RPCs under the `rpcs` section. For chain names, refer to https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chain-selectors/blob/main/selectors.yml

## 5. Deploy contracts and prepare ABIs

### 5a. Deploy contracts

Deploy the BalanceReader, MessageEmitter, ReserveManager and SimpleERC20 contracts. You can either do this on a local chain or on a testnet using tools like cast/foundry.

For a quick start, you can also use the pre-deployed contract addresses on Ethereum Sepolia—no action required on your part if you're just trying things out.

### 5b. Prepare ABIs

For each contract you would like to interact with, you need to provide the ABI `.ts` file so that TypeScript can provide type safety and autocomplete for the contract methods. The format of the ABI files is very similar to regular JSON format; you just need to export it as a variable and mark it `as const`. For example:

```ts
// IERC20.ts file
export const IERC20Abi = {
  // ... your ABI here ...
} as const;
```

For a quick start, every contract used in this workflow is already provided in the `contracts` folder. You can use them as a reference.

## 6. Configure workflow

Configure `config.json` for the workflow

- `schedule` should be set to `"0 */1 * * * *"` for every 1 minute(s) or any other cron expression you prefer, note [CRON service quotas](https://docs.chain.link/cre/service-quotas)
- `url` should be set to existing reserves HTTP endpoint API
- `tokenAddress` should be the SimpleERC20 contract address
- `porAddress` should be the ReserveManager contract address
- `proxyAddress` should be the UpdateReservesProxySimplified contract address
- `balanceReaderAddress` should be the BalanceReader contract address
- `messageEmitterAddress` should be the MessageEmitter contract address
- `chainSelectorName` should be human-readable chain name of selected chain (refer to https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chain-selectors/blob/main/selectors.yml)
- `gasLimit` should be the gas limit of chain write

The config is already populated with deployed contracts in template.

Note: Make sure your `workflow.yaml` file is pointing to the config.json, example:

```yaml
staging-settings:
  user-workflow:
    workflow-name: "workflow01"
  workflow-artifacts:
    workflow-path: "./main.ts"
    config-path: "./config.json"
    secrets-path: ""
```

## 7. Simulate the workflow

Run the command from <b>project root directory</b> and pass in the path to the workflow directory.

```bash
cre workflow simulate <path-to-workflow-directory>
```

For a workflow directory named `workflow01` the exact command would be:

```bash
cre workflow simulate ./workflow01
```

After this you will get a set of options similar to:

```
🚀 Workflow simulation ready. Please select a trigger:
1. cron-trigger@1.0.0 Trigger
2. evm:ChainSelector:16015286601757825753@1.0.0 LogTrigger

Enter your choice (1-2):
```

You can simulate each of the following triggers types as follows

### 7a. Simulating Cron Trigger Workflows

Select option 1, and the workflow should immediately execute.

### 7b. Simulating Log Trigger Workflows

Select option 2, and then two additional prompts will come up and you can pass in the example inputs:

Transaction Hash: 0x9394cc015736e536da215c31e4f59486a8d85f4cfc3641e309bf00c34b2bf410
Log Event Index: 0

The output will look like:

```
