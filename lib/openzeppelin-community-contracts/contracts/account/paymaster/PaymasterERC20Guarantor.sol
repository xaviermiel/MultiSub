/**
 * @dev Extension of {PaymasterERC20} that enables third parties to guarantee user operations.
 *
 * This contract allows a guarantor to pre-fund user operations on behalf of users. The guarantor
 * pays the maximum possible gas cost upfront, and after execution:
 * 1. If the user repays the guarantor, the guarantor gets their funds back
 * 2. If the user fails to repay, the guarantor absorbs the cost
 *
 * A common use case is for guarantors to pay for the operations of users claiming airdrops. In this scenario:
 *
 * * The guarantor pays the gas fees upfront
 * * The user claims their airdrop tokens
 * * The user repays the guarantor from the claimed tokens
 * * If the user fails to repay, the guarantor absorbs the cost
 *
 * The guarantor is identified through the {_fetchGuarantor} function, which must be implemented
 * by developers to determine who can guarantee operations. This allows for flexible guarantor selection
 * logic based on the specific requirements of the application.
