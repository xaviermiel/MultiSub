Gateways are contracts that enable cross-chain communication. These can either be a message source or a destination according to ERC-7786.

 * {ERC7786Receiver}: ERC-7786 cross-chain message receiver.
 * {ERC7786OpenBridge}: ERC-7786 "N out of M" gateway. Sends a message through M gateways and executes on the destination if N received it.

Developers can access interoperability protocols through gateway adapters. The library includes the following gateway adapters:

 * {AxelarGatewayAdapter}: ERC-7786 gateway adapter for Axelar.
