NOTE: This document is better viewed at https://docs.openzeppelin.com/community-contracts/utils/cryptography

A collection of contracts and libraries that implement various signature validation schemes and cryptographic primitives. These utilities enable secure authentication, multisignature operations, and advanced cryptographic operations in smart contracts.

 * {ZKEmailUtils}: Library for ZKEmail signature validation utilities, enabling email-based authentication through zero-knowledge proofs.
 * {DKIMRegistry}: Implementation of https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7969[ERC-7969] to enable onchain verification of DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) signatures.
 * {SignerZKEmail}: Implementation of an https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/utils/cryptography#AbstractSigner[AbstractSigner] that enables email-based authentication through zero-knowledge proofs.
 * {ERC7913ZKEmailVerifier}: Ready to use ERC-7913 signature verifiers for ZKEmail.
